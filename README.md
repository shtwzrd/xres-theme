#xres-theme

A theme that queries xrdb in order to dynamically create an Emacs theme.
This works for both GUI and terminal Emacs, preserving translucent bg-color,
if present.

Currently unsuitable for inclusion into Spacemacs Contrib as it assumes a
24bit color escape code patched Emacs.

If you're looking for something similar just for GUI Emacs, check out
Xresources-theme on MELPA.
